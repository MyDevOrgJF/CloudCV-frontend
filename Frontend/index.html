            <p>
                I am a motivated Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience delivering robust,
                maintainable software in Legal Tech and FinTech. Proficient in C#, .NET, SQL Server, and
                experienced building projects with JavaScript and JS frameworks. Most recently at Summize, I learnt
                Angular and TypeScript to be able to deliver bug fixes and improvements to their web app. Skilled in developing both
                front-end and back-end systems, with a proven ability to learn new technologies quickly and contribute solutions to complex problems on
                high-impact projects. I support my team through maintaining documentation and helping other engineers with queries and
                blockers. In my personal time, I work on side projects for fun and to learn new skills. This has included
                creating React apps and Unity Game Engine projects. For my next role, I hope to find an environment that enables me to
                continue developing my skills on interesting and challenging projects.

                        Migrated 100k+ rows of fund and trade data to align with Bloomberg data changes using complex,

                        data validation. This had to be done on the same day and time Bloomberg was going to go live
                        with the new data, making it a high-risk project for the business.

                <h3>Improved Spotify Shuffle</h3>
                <p>
                    I built a React-based web app to improve Spotify shuffle playback. I was annoyed with how the
                    Spotify shuffle
                    playback was not very random at the time, it would repeat recently played songs on my large
                    playlists. I improved it
                    by saving locally data of played songs with a date and time played. Using a function I made in my
                    app, I can auto skip
                    songs last played in a selectable date range. To interact with Spotify, and retrieve their data I
                    needed I used Spotify’s
                    API and player SDK. It runs in web browsers. I styled it with CSS and made the view adaptive for
                    mobile and PC resolutions.
                    It has a server layer that runs on Node to make the API calls. Deployed on Fly.io.

                <p>
                    I built an Azure-based project after achieving the Microsoft AZ-900 certification, to demonstrate
                    practical cloud skills
                    and applied knowledge. It is a static website version of my CV hosted on Azure. On the frontend it
                    is html, CSS and JS.
                    A JavaScript page visitor counter stores and retrieves data from an Azure Cosmos DB using an Azure
                    Functions API written
                    in C# with unit tests. Azure Frontdoor was used to configure my custom domain name. Backend and
                    frontend code are on
                    separate GitHub repositories with GitHub Action workflows setup for CI/CD. So, whenever I make a
                    change to either repo
                    it automatically deploys to Azure after running tests.

                    project called <em>Star Dash: Infinity</em>.

                    Ads are delivered by Googles Ad Mob using their SDK. It was deployed on Android Play Store.
